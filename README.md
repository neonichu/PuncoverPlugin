# Xcode plugin for displaying information in the gutter.

![project deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/project%20status-deprecated-red.svg)

This project is deprecated in favor of [Editor Extensions](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/414/) support in Xcode 8+.

![Screenshot of the plugin in action](screenshots/puncover-plugin.png)

It will display JSON from *.gutter.json* in the current project's directory, example:

```json
{ "/some/file": [
  {
    "line": 23,
    "long_text": "Some longer text in a tooltip when hovering over the line.",
    "name": "main",
    "short_text": "gutter text",
    "background_color":"0x35CC4B"
  }
] }
```

see [this file](Resources/test.json) for more information. This enables the integration of abitrary tools and scripts into Xcode without the need to write yet another plugin.

## Current applications

- Show code coverage information, generated with [slather][5]. If you already have set it up, slather can generate a suitable *.gutter.json* by simply running:

        $ slather coverage -g path/to/project.xcodeproj

- Show code size information of [Pebble][1] applications, using [puncover][2] - this also inspired the name of this plugin.

- Show findings of [Faux Pas][3], using [this script][4] to convert the JSON.

## Installation

Either

- Clone and build the plugin yourself, it will be installed to the right location automatically by building it.

or

- Install it via [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/)

In any case, relaunch Xcode to load it.
